# Austria-Vaccination-IMDB-comparison

This little just-for-fun project shows you a movie from IMDB that has the same rating (in percent) as the current vaccination rate in Austria is (rounded). For this, the current vaccination data from the Austrian Ministry of Health as well as movies from the IMDB dataset file for rating are retrieved at each call.
